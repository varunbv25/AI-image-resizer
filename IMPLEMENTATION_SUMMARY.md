# Vercel Blob Upload - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Complete Vercel Blob client upload solution for **both single file and batch processing** to bypass Vercel's 4.5MB serverless function payload limit.

## ✨ Key Features

### Single File Upload
- Automatic detection (files >3MB use blob upload)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Immediate blob deletion after processing

### Batch Upload  
- Concurrent uploads (default: 3)
- Per-file and overall progress tracking
- Mixed upload methods (blob + traditional)
- Individual error handling
