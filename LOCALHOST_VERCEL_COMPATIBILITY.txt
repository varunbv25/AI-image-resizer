✅ LOCALHOST AND VERCEL COMPATIBILITY IMPLEMENTED

Changes Made:
1. Added fallback logic in blob upload functions
2. Graceful degradation when BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN not available
3. Automatic compression for large files on localhost
4. Works seamlessly on both environments

How It Works:

LOCALHOST (without BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN):
- Files >3MB: Tries blob upload → Fails → Compresses to 2MB → Traditional upload
- Files ≤3MB: Traditional upload
- No errors, smooth fallback

VERCEL (with BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN):
- Files >3MB: Blob upload (bypasses 4.5MB limit)
- Files ≤3MB: Traditional upload
- Full blob storage functionality

Testing:
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Localhost: ✅ Works without blob token
- Vercel: ✅ Works with blob token

No configuration needed on localhost!
