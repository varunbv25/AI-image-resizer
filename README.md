## 🧮 Processing Algorithms

### AI Image Resizing Algorithms

#### Primary Method: AI-Powered Extension
- **Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview
- **Technique**: Generative AI background extension
- **Process**:
  1. Sends original image with target dimensions to Gemini AI
  2. AI model analyzes image content, style, colors, lighting, and textures
  3. Generates seamless background extension matching original image characteristics
  4. Validates output against target dimensions
  5. Crops to exact dimensions if needed using center-crop algorithm

#### Fallback Method: Edge Color Detection
- **Library**: Sharp.js
- **Algorithm**: Statistical edge sampling with weighted averaging
- **Process**:
  1. **Edge Sampling**: Extracts pixel data from all four edges (top, bottom, left, right)
     - Edge thickness: 3% of smallest dimension (min 3px, max 15px)
     - Samples full width/height of each edge
  2. **Color Analysis**: Calculates mean RGB values for each edge using Sharp.js `.stats()` method
  3. **Weighted Averaging**:
     - Top and bottom edges: 1.5x weight (more representative)
     - Left and right edges: 1.0x weight
     - Formula: `RGB = Σ(edge_color × weight) / total_weight`
  4. **Canvas Creation**: Creates new canvas with detected background color
  5. **Image Compositing**: Centers original image on canvas using Sharp.js `.composite()`
  6. **Final Resize**: Ensures exact target dimensions with `.resize(fit: 'fill')`

### Manual Cropping Algorithm

- **Library**: Sharp.js
- **Method**: High-precision region extraction
- **Process**:
  1. **Scale Calculation**: Determines optimal scale to cover target area
     - `scale = max(targetWidth/originalWidth, targetHeight/originalHeight)`
  2. **Resize**: Scales image using calculated factor
  3. **Extract**: Uses Sharp.js `.extract()` method for pixel-perfect cropping
     - Calculates center position: `(scaledDimension - targetDimension) / 2`
     - Extracts exact region with specified x, y, width, height
  4. **Quality Preservation**: Maintains high quality (85-90%) during crop operation

### Upscaling Algorithm

- **Library**: Sharp.js
- **Resampling Kernel**: Lanczos3
- **Method**: High-quality interpolation-based upscaling
- **Process**:
  1. **Validation**: Ensures target dimensions ≥ original dimensions
  2. **Lanczos3 Resampling**:
     - Uses 3-lobe Lanczos windowed sinc filter
     - Kernel size: 6×6 pixel neighborhood
     - Provides superior edge preservation and sharpness
     - Optimal for photographic content and detail retention
  3. **Progressive Encoding**:
     - JPEG: Progressive scan encoding for web optimization
     - Multiple scan passes for faster perceived loading
  4. **Format Optimization**:
     - JPEG: Progressive encoding with configurable quality
     - PNG: Lossless with quality settings
     - WebP: Modern compression with quality control

**Algorithm Characteristics**:
- **Type**: Bicubic interpolation with windowed sinc function
- **Quality**: Superior to bilinear/bicubic for upscaling
- **Edge Handling**: Excellent sharpness preservation
- **Performance**: Optimized C++ implementation via Sharp.js

### Image Compression Algorithms

- **Library**: Sharp.js
- **Strategy**: Iterative quality reduction with format-specific optimization

#### Compression Process
1. **Initial Compression**:
   - Starting quality: 80% (JPEG/WebP) or level 9 (PNG)
   - Format-specific encoder selection
2. **Iterative Optimization**:
   - Compares output size to target size
   - If size > target: reduces quality by 10% and recompresses
   - Maximum attempts: 10 iterations
   - Minimum quality threshold: 10%
3. **Algorithm**: Binary search-like approach with fixed decrements
   - `quality_n = max(10, quality_{n-1} - 10)`
   - Stops when: `outputSize ≤ targetSize` OR `quality ≤ 10` OR `attempts ≥ 10`

#### Format-Specific Algorithms

**JPEG Compression:**
- **Encoder**: MozJPEG
- **Method**: Optimized JPEG encoding with trellis quantization
- **Features**:
  - Progressive scan encoding for better web loading
  - Optimized Huffman tables
  - Trellis quantization for better quality/size ratio
- **Settings**: Quality 10-80, progressive: true

**PNG Compression:**
- **Method**: DEFLATE compression with palette optimization
- **Settings**:
  - Compression level: 9 (maximum)
  - Palette: true (enables palette optimization for smaller file sizes)
- **Algorithm**: Lossless compression with optimal filtering
- **Note**: Quality parameter affects filtering, not lossy compression

**WebP Compression:**
- **Method**: VP8/VP8L compression
- **Type**: Lossy compression (for quality < 100)
- **Settings**: Quality 10-80
- **Algorithm**: Block-based prediction with transform coding
- **Advantages**: Better compression than JPEG at equivalent quality

### Data Flow

#### AI Image Resizing Mode
1. **File Upload**: User uploads image → `useFileUpload` → `/api/upload` → File validation & metadata extraction
2. **Dimension Selection**: User selects target dimensions → State update → Preview update
3. **AI Processing**: User clicks process → `useImageProcessing` → `/api/process` → AI extension or edge fallback
4. **Download**: Processed image → Base64 to blob conversion → Browser download

#### Manual Cropping Mode
1. **File Upload**: User uploads image → `useFileUpload` → `/api/upload` → File validation & metadata extraction
2. **Interactive Positioning**: User drags image within crop frame → Real-time position updates
3. **Zoom & Scale**: User adjusts zoom → Image scale updates → Crop preview updates
4. **Crop Processing**: User clicks crop → Manual crop logic → `/api/compress` → Sharp.js cropping
5. **Download**: Cropped image → Base64 to blob conversion → Browser download

#### Upscaling Mode (with Batch Processing)
1. **File Upload**: User uploads single or multiple images → `useFileUpload` → `/api/upload` → File validation & metadata extraction
2. **Batch Queue Creation**: All uploaded images added to batch queue → Each item gets unique ID, status set to 'pending'
3. **Sidebar Display**: Images displayed in sidebar with thumbnails, status icons (Clock, Check, AlertCircle), and file info
4. **Settings Configuration**:
   - **Option A - Per-Image**: User selects image from sidebar → Customize scale factor, target resolution, quality for that specific image → Click "Process This Image"
   - **Option B - Batch Default**: Click "Upscale All Images" to use default settings for all pending images
5. **Sequential Processing**: Images processed one at a time → Status updates from 'pending' → 'processing' → 'completed' or 'error'
6. **Upscale Processing**: For each image → `useUpscaling` → `/api/upscale` → Advanced interpolation with per-image settings
7. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates in sidebar, selected image shows full details in main content area
8. **Download Options**:
   - **Single Image**: Click download button on individual completed image
   - **Batch Download**: Click "Download All" to get ZIP file of all completed images (uses JSZip)

#### Image Compression Mode (with Batch Processing)
1. **File Upload**: User uploads single or multiple images → `useFileUpload` → `/api/upload` → File validation & metadata extraction
2. **Batch Queue Creation**: All uploaded images added to batch queue → Each item gets unique ID, status set to 'pending', original size stored
3. **Sidebar Display**: Images displayed in sidebar with thumbnails, status icons (Clock, Check, AlertCircle), and file size info
4. **Settings Configuration**:
   - **Option A - Per-Image**: User selects image from sidebar → Adjust target file size slider (with wheel scroll support) for that specific image → Real-time target size calculation → Click "Compress This Image"
   - **Option B - Batch Default**: Click "Compress All Images" to use default target size (40%) for all pending images
5. **Sequential Processing**: Images processed one at a time → Status updates from 'pending' → 'processing' → 'completed' or 'error'
6. **Compression Processing**: For each image → Compression logic → `/api/compress-image` → Iterative quality adjustment with per-image target size
7. **Algorithm Execution**:
   - Initial compression with optimal quality (80% for JPEG/WebP, level 9 for PNG)
   - Format-specific compression:
     - JPEG: MozJPEG with progressive encoding
     - PNG: Level 9 compression with palette optimization
     - WebP: 80% quality compression
   - If file size exceeds target: Reduce quality by 10% and retry
   - Repeat up to 10 times or until quality reaches 10% minimum
8. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates in sidebar, selected image shows compression results in main content area
9. **Results Display**: Compressed image preview → Shows original size, compressed size, target size, and compression ratio
10. **Download Options**:
    - **Single Image**: Click download button on individual completed image
    - **Batch Download**: Click "Download All" to get ZIP file of all compressed images (uses JSZip)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Environment Setup for Production

1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is properly configured
3. Configure proper CORS settings if needed

### Recommended Hosting Platforms

- **Vercel**: Optimized for Next.js applications
- **Netlify**: Easy deployment with git integration
- **Railway**: Simple deployment with automatic HTTPS
- **AWS**: For enterprise-scale deployments

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New Components**: Add to `src/components/`
2. **API Routes**: Add to `src/app/api/`
3. **Utilities**: Add to `src/lib/`
4. **Types**: Update `src/types/index.ts`

### Code Style

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components for consistency

### Testing

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working (AI Image Resizing)**
   - Verify your Gemini API key is correct
   - Check the key has proper permissions
   - Ensure `.env.local` is in the root directory
   - AI mode will fallback to edge extension if API fails

2. **File Upload Fails**
   - Check file size is under 10MB
   - Verify file format is supported (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
   - Try a different image file
   - Ensure browser supports modern JavaScript features

3. **AI Processing Issues**
   - Large images may take longer to process
   - Check your internet connection
   - Fallback edge extension will be used if AI fails
   - Monitor processing status for detailed error messages

4. **Manual Cropping Problems**
   - Ensure image is properly loaded before attempting to crop
   - Check that crop frame is within image boundaries
   - Verify target dimensions are reasonable
   - Clear browser cache if canvas rendering issues occur

5. **Upscaling Limitations**
   - Very large upscale factors (>4x) may fail or take excessive time
   - Check available system memory for large image processing
   - Consider reducing image size before upscaling
   - Use batch processing for multiple smaller images rather than one very large image

6. **Build Errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
   - Clear `.next` folder and rebuild
   - Verify TypeScript configuration is correct

7. **Sharp Module Loading Error**
   - Run `npm install --include=optional sharp`
   - Rebuild Sharp: `npm rebuild sharp`
   - For platform-specific issues, try: `npm install --os=win32 --cpu=x64 sharp`
   - Check system architecture compatibility

8. **Performance Issues**
   - Large images may cause browser memory issues
   - Consider resizing images before processing
   - Close other browser tabs to free memory
   - Use smaller batch sizes for upscaling operations

### Mode-Specific Tips

**AI Image Resizing:**
- Works best with images that have clear subjects and backgrounds
- Fallback mode provides reliable results when AI is unavailable
- Complex or abstract images may benefit from manual cropping instead

**Manual Cropping:**
- Use zoom controls for precise positioning
- Drag from the center of the image for better control
- Preview updates in real-time to show exact crop area
- Upload multiple images and customize crop settings for each one
- Click images in the sidebar to switch between them quickly
- Use "Crop All Images" for batch processing with consistent settings

**Upscaling:**
- Minimum scale factor is 1.1x (10% enlargement)
- Start with smaller scale factors (1.5x-2x) for best results
- Higher quality settings may significantly increase processing time
- Batch processing works best with images of similar sizes
- Target resolution inputs enforce minimum values based on original dimensions
- Select individual images from sidebar to customize scale factor and quality
- Use "Upscale All Images" for consistent batch processing
- Monitor real-time status for each image in the sidebar (pending, processing, completed)

**Image Compression:**
- Quality is automatically optimized - starts at 80% for JPEG/WebP, level 9 for PNG
- Lower target file size percentages (10-30%) result in more aggressive quality reduction
- JPEG format typically provides best compression ratios for photos
- PNG works best for graphics, logos, and images with transparency
- WebP offers excellent compression for modern web applications
- Use mouse wheel scroll on slider for fine-grained control
- Algorithm may compress more than expected due to image content
- If compression ratio seems insufficient, try a lower target percentage
- Select individual images from sidebar to set custom target size percentage
- Use "Compress All Images" for batch processing with default 40% target
- View compression statistics (original, compressed, target sizes) for each completed image
