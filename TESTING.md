# Testing Vercel Blob Upload Implementation

## Quick Test Checklist

### Before Deploying

1. **Verify Environment Variables**
```bash
# Check .env.local has the blob token
cat .env.local | grep BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
```

2. **Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Test Small File (< 3MB)**
   - Upload a 2MB image
   - Should work with both old and new methods
   - Verify processing completes successfully

4. **Test Medium File (3-10MB)**
   - Upload a 5MB image (previously failed!)
   - Should upload via blob without errors
   - Verify no `FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` error
   - Check console for "Fetching image from blob" log

5. **Test Large File (> 10MB)**
   - Upload a 20MB+ image
   - Watch upload progress indicator
   - Verify processing completes
   - Check blob is cleaned up after processing

### After Deploying to Vercel

1. **Create Blob Store**
   - Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Storage â†’ Blob
   - Click "Create Database" â†’ "Blob"
   - Token is automatically added to environment variables

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel Blob support for unlimited file uploads"
git push
```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check Vercel deployment logs
   - Verify `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is set in environment variables
   - Test with production URL

4. **Production Tests**
   - Test Image Compression mode with 5MB file
   - Test AI Resizing mode with 10MB file
   - Verify upload progress shows
   - Check processing completes successfully

## Test Files

Create test images of various sizes:

```bash
# Using ImageMagick (if installed)
convert -size 1000x1000 xc:white test-1mb.jpg
convert -size 2000x2000 xc:white test-5mb.jpg
convert -size 3000x3000 xc:white test-15mb.jpg
convert -size 5000x5000 xc:white test-50mb.jpg
```

Or download sample large images:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) - High-resolution photos
- [Pexels](https://pexels.com) - Free stock photos
- Use your phone to take high-res photos (usually 3-10MB)

## Expected Behavior

### Image Compression Mode

**Small Files (< 3MB):**
- âœ… May use base64 (legacy) or blob (new)
- âœ… Should process successfully
- âœ… No errors in console

**Medium Files (3-10MB):**
- âœ… **Automatic blob upload**
- âœ… Upload progress indicator shows
- âœ… Console log: "Fetching image from blob: https://..."
- âœ… Console log: "Cleaned up blob: https://..."
- âœ… Processing completes successfully
- âœ… **No FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE error**

**Large Files (> 10MB):**
- âœ… Direct blob upload
- âœ… Upload may take a few seconds (progress shown)
- âœ… Processing works normally
- âœ… Download works

### AI Resizing Mode

**With Blob Support:**
- âœ… Accepts files of any size
- âœ… Uploads to blob first
- âœ… Sends blob URL to `/api/process`
- âœ… Server fetches and processes
- âœ… Cleanup after completion

## Console Logs to Look For

### Successful Blob Upload
```
Uploading file: image.jpg (5.2MB)
Upload progress: 100%
Blob uploaded successfully: https://blob.vercel-storage.com/...
Upload complete
```

### Server Processing
```
Fetching image from blob: https://blob.vercel-storage.com/...
Compression complete
Cleaned up blob: https://blob.vercel-storage.com/...
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN not found"
**Fix:**
```bash
# Local dev: Add to .env.local
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_...

# Vercel: Create blob store in dashboard
```

### Issue: Upload works but "Failed to fetch image from blob storage"
**Possible causes:**
1. Blob URL expired (default: 1 hour)
2. Network connectivity issue
3. Blob was already deleted

**Fix:**
- Re-upload the file
- Check network connection
- Verify blob URL format

### Issue: Still getting payload errors
**Check:**
1. Are you using `useFileUploadWithBlob` hook?
2. Is component passing `blobUrl` to API?
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Slow uploads
**Expected:**
- 5MB file: ~2-5 seconds
- 20MB file: ~10-20 seconds
- 50MB file: ~30-60 seconds

Depends on your internet upload speed.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Upload Times (on 10 Mbps connection)

| File Size | Upload Time | Processing Time | Total |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 MB      | < 1s        | 1-2s            | ~2s   |
| 5 MB      | 2-4s        | 2-3s            | ~6s   |
| 10 MB     | 5-8s        | 3-5s            | ~12s  |
| 20 MB     | 10-15s      | 5-8s            | ~20s  |
| 50 MB     | 30-40s      | 10-15s          | ~50s  |

## Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Small files (< 3MB) work
- [ ] Medium files (3-10MB) work without payload errors
- [ ] Large files (> 10MB) work
- [ ] Upload progress shows correctly
- [ ] Processing completes successfully
- [ ] Download works
- [ ] Console shows blob cleanup logs
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] No errors in Vercel logs (if deployed)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily disable blob uploads:

1. Comment out blob upload in `ImageCompression.tsx`:
```typescript
// const { upload } = await import('@vercel/blob/client');
// Use legacy base64 upload instead
```

2. Add file size warnings:
```typescript
if (file.size > 3 * 1024 * 1024) {
  alert('Please compress file to under 3MB');
  return;
}
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… All tests pass
âœ… No payload size errors for files up to 50MB
âœ… Upload progress works
âœ… Processing completes successfully
âœ… Blobs are cleaned up automatically
âœ… Backward compatibility maintained

## Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. Update remaining modes (Manual Cropping, Upscaling, Enhancement, Rotate/Flip)
2. Add blob support to batch processing
3. Consider adding file size limits for cost control
4. Monitor blob storage usage in Vercel dashboard
